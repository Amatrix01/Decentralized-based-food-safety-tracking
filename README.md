Decentralized Based Food Safety Tracking
Project Description
The Decentralized Based Food Safety Tracking system is a blockchain-based solution that ensures transparency, traceability, and safety throughout the food supply chain. This smart contract enables tracking of food products from farm to consumer, providing an immutable record of each product's journey and enabling rapid response to food safety issues.

Key Features
Product Registration: Farmers can register new food products with origin details, harvest dates, and expiry information
Supply Chain Tracking: Complete traceability as products move through different stakeholders (farmers, processors, distributors, retailers)
Contamination Reporting: Immediate contamination alerts and recall mechanisms to protect consumer safety
Participant Verification: Role-based access control ensuring only verified participants can interact with the system
Historical Records: Immutable tracking history and ownership records for complete transparency
Core Smart Contract Functions
registerProduct(): Allows verified participants to register new food products in the supply chain
transferProduct(): Enables secure transfer of product ownership between verified participants
reportContamination(): Provides mechanism to report contamination and trigger recall processes
Technology Stack
Solidity: Smart contract development
Ethereum Blockchain: Decentralized infrastructure
OpenZeppelin: Security standards and patterns
Use Cases
Consumer Safety: Consumers can verify product authenticity and safety status
Regulatory Compliance: Authorities can audit the complete supply chain history
Rapid Recalls: Instant identification and isolation of contaminated products
Supply Chain Optimization: Stakeholders can track efficiency and identify bottlenecks
Insurance Claims: Automated processing based on verifiable supply chain data

Getting Started
Install dependencies:
bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
Compile the contract:
bash
npx hardhat compile
Deploy to your preferred network:
bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
Security Considerations
Role-based access control prevents unauthorized operations
Input validation ensures data integrity
Contamination flags prevent transfer of unsafe products
Expiry date checks maintain food safety standards
Future Enhancements
Integration with IoT sensors for real-time monitoring
IPFS integration for storing certificates and test results
Mobile app for QR code scanning by consumers
Oracle integration for external data sources
Multi-chain deployment for global supply chains
